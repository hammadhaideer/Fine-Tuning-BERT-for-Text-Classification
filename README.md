Fine-Tuning BERT for Sequence Classification
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a BERT model for sequence classification tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook covers the following key steps:

Overview
Dataset Loading: Utilizes the datasets library to load and preprocess the GLUE MRPC dataset.
Tokenizer and Data Collation: Configures the BERT tokenizer and sets up dynamic padding and data collation for efficient training.
Model Fine-Tuning: Implements a training loop to fine-tune BERT on the MRPC dataset, adjusting hyperparameters and training settings.
Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on the validation set to assess accuracy and other metrics.
Accelerate Integration: Uses the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library to adapt the training loop for multi-GPU or TPU setups for scalable training.
